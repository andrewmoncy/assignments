        Google Fonts makes it easy to bring personality and performance to your websites and products. Our robust catalog of open-source fonts and icons makes it easy to integrate expressive type and icons seamlessly — no matter where you are in the world.
        We all use type every day, from word processors and social media graphic apps to professional desktop design software and hand-coded websites. Good typography is within everyone’s reach, and it starts with the fundamentals. This module acts as an accessible primer for anyone to build confidence and skills, and is also a solid foundation for experienced designers looking to deepen their understanding of the basics.
        Making our text readable should be our primary goal when setting and manipulating type. Readability—along with the closely related concepts of legibility and accessibility—is at the core of typography, and yet it’s rarely discussed thoroughly in typographic contexts. In these articles, we examine the qualities of type and typography that make reading easier.
