Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. 
The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.

An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent. 
If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.
