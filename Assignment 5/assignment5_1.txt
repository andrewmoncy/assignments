SEO or Search Engine Optimization is the process of making websites more visible in terms of search results and search rankings.

It is important because Search engines crawl the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. 
If you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for e-commerce and ads).
