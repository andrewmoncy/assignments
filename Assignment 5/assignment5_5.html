A favicon is a small, 16x16 pixel icon used on web browsers to represent a website or a web page. Short for favorite icon favicons are commonly displayed on tabs at the top of a web browser but they are also found on your browser bookmark bar, history and in search results, alongside the page url. 
In some instances, such as on Google Chrome, favicons will even make an appearance on your browser homepage. In other words, when you create a favicon, it serves as your websites icon, or a visual identifier for users to spot your website around the web.
A favicon may also be referred to as a shortcut icon, tab icon, URL icon or bookmark icon.
