Operations in JavaScript involve one or more operands and an operator. And operators can be categorized based on the number of operands they require.

Unary operators require one operand for operation. Providing two or more can result in a syntax error.

Ex:   typeof = "hi" returns string (here typeof is the operator and "hi" is the operand)


Binary operators require two operand for operation. Providing more than two or less than two can result in a syntax error.

Ex:   10 > 20 (here 10 and 20 are the two operands, it returns true or false)


Ternary operators require three operands. In JavaScript the conditional operator acts as the ternary operator.

Ex:   const voterid= age>=18 ? "Eligible" : "Not Eligible" ( here age>=18 is one operand while the other two are true and false conditions)
