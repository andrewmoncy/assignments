Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-) and when using parentheses, operations inside the parentheses are computed first.

When there is an expression where there are operators with same preference like + and - OR * and /, they get their prefence from left to right.
