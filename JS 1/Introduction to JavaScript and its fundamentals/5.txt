Comments are a way of improving readabilty and quality of a code. Since they are non executable they can be used to insert information regarding code during programming so that it becomes easier to debug and rectify errors in code at a later stage.

Example of single line and multi line comments are:

//This is a single line comment

/*
This is a multiline comment
that can span as many lines.
