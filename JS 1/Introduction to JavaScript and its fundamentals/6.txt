Choosing names for variables are important for improving code readability because the variable name can be used to easily identify its purpose and can be useful when debugging a code.

In the below example the function calculateSimpleInterest() clearly defines its purpose and so does the variables like simpleInterest, principal etc.

function calculateSimpleInterest(p,r,t){
let simpleInterest=(p*r*t)/100;
return simpleInterest;
}
let principal=1000;
let rate=12;
let time=3;
console.log(`Calculated simple interest is = ${calculateSimpleInterest(principal,rate,time)}`);
